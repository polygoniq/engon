## About

> engon is a small code-only addon that contains all asset addon functionality: spawning, variants,
> find missing files, snap to > ground, animations, ... All the former addon functionality: botaniq
> scatter, ... in one big addon containing all the code. That way we can ship bug fixes and add
> even more functionality very quickly. And you can auto-update without downloading tens of GB of
> assets every time.

> supported.

### Installation

how to set it up as remote repository so you can install and update everything from Blender.

#### Blender 4.1 or older
##### Download the addon ZIP

|                          Stable Release                                                  |                         Unstable Master Branch                   |

| Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/polygoniq/engon/releases) for a stable ZIP.   | Click `Code` -> `Download ZIP` if you are feeling adventurous.   |

##### Install ZIP in Blender

Go to `Edit` -> `Preferences`. And select `Add-ons` in the left bar. Click the `Install...` button
in the top section. Select the ZIP file you just downloaded and click `Install Add-on`. After the
installation finishes, check the checkbox next to the `engon` addon.

### Updating

The addon can auto-update itself to latest stable or even unstable master version. Head over to
`Edit` -> `Preferences` and select `Add-ons` in the left bar. Type `engon` into the search bar

update intervals or even update manually.
