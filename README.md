## About

> engon is a small code-only addon that contains all asset addon functionality: spawning, variants,
> find missing files, snap to > ground, animations, ... All the former addon functionality: botaniq
> scatter, ... in one big addon containing all the code. That way we can ship bug fixes and add
> even more functionality very quickly. And you can auto-update without downloading tens of GB of
> assets every time.
